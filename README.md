# 4 WEEK HTML/JS PROJECT

#### THE TASK AT HAND:
A 4 week project to create a HR application...

#### By _**Sakeena Ali**_

## What was the Challenge?
To create a HR application which contains employee information, that also needed to capture the following data:

- Employee's NI Number
- Employee's Full Name
- Employee's Phone number
- Employee's Address
- Employee's Department
 (Note: we were not to use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine)
 
 (seemed straight forward enough... but then🥁🥁🥁... we needed to meet the following **seven**👀 requirements)
 
1. The project **must** be written in PURE JavaScript 
2. All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
3. Users **must** be able to add an employee to the list 
4. Users **must** be able to edit employee information 
5. Users **must** be able to delete an employee 
6. Users **must** be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc. 
7. You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.

(I know what you're thinking... **only** seven?)

There was one aspect that stood out for me... *Be as **creative** as you'd like with the design of the application*

## How I expected the challenge to go.
Personally, four weeks of being highly caffeinated. Other than that, the requirements were not easy, however my mindset was to complete everything, by using what I had learnt from the training, we also had recordings of the class time with QA and my notes to refer back to. 

## What went well

The basic construct of the table was easy, and any HTML was straightforward as long as you keep to the basic principals there should be no issues. Furthermore creating the style sheet was the most enjoyable. I am very much a visual learner, and it was aesthetically pleasing to see how a item I have been working on looked less like a seventies text book diagram, mind you my 7 year old did choose the colours for the HR table, and it did end up looking like a pack of 'parma violet sweets'

Also the willingness of others to help, much of my work would not have been done without the sheer concerted efforts of colleagues helping to check my code for me, or to give me pointers and advice. 


## What didnt go as planned?

Where do I start?...😳

**ERROR 1** I had hardcoded the records into the table, visually it looked more or less perfect, and my trainer was impressed...till he saw the code. So had to start that again.

**ERROR 2** I had managed to make what seemed to be a data submission form for HR, but the code was mostly in HTML, I realised this after looking back at the recordings and a submission of a colleagues on GIThub. 
By now I had used up two weeks on this, but knowing where I had made the mistakes, I formed a new plan, and the third time round, I managed to form a code of how a loop could collect the data from Records.js and display on the chrome page. 

Also, after speaking to my manager, the advice I got, was to look at code that was available and incorporate this, not to just rely on the class material, my own notes or even just the websites I was approved to use. That the options for help were alot wider in order to complete and meet the deadline. 

## Possible improvements for future challenges

Javascript I found is harder than initally perceived, but the key is planning. I had not dated my notes from the class meetings, if I had done this, then I would be able to refer faster and easier back to the recordings to follow the instructions and demos, as a result, I was sifting through 4-5 hours of footage per day, to find the exact demonstrations I needed.

Also, more practice is needed, Javascript is all very new to me, but I can see with maybe a few months practice I could complete something similar to this project without having to refer too much to other sources. It would also be a possible consideration for those of us who are not as strong at the tasks, to maybe work in pairs, this gives an oppurtunity of team effort and learning from one another too.
